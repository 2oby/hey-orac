## 🌐 NEW PRIORITY: Web Admin Console & API Integration

### 1. 🔥 **CRITICAL PRIORITY: Detection Blocking Issue - FIXED** ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Priority**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Detection blocking issue fixed

**Issue**: Engine detected wake words but no file was created for web interface
**Root Cause**: Cooldown/debounce checks were applied AFTER audio processing, blocking file creation
**Solution**: Moved cooldown/debounce checks BEFORE audio processing

**✅ FIX IMPLEMENTED**:
- ✅ Fixed detection logic in `src/monitor_custom_model.py`
- ✅ Fixed detection logic in `src/audio_pipeline.py`
- ✅ Cooldown/debounce now applied before audio processing
- ✅ File creation and web interface updates now work correctly

**✅ FIX DETAILS**:
- ✅ **Before**: Process audio → Get detection → Apply cooldown → Block file creation
- ✅ **After**: Check cooldown → Process audio → Get detection → Create file
- ✅ Detection logs and file creation now work together
- ✅ Web interface receives detection data correctly
- ✅ `/tmp/recent_detections.json` file is created with detection data

**✅ VERIFICATION TOOLS**:
- ✅ `scripts/verify_detection_fix.sh` - Check current detection status
