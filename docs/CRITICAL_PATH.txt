# CRITICAL PATH - Hey Orac Voice Control System

## ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Phase 1a - Basic Project Running)

### 1. Fix PATH Warnings in Docker Container
- [x] Update Dockerfile to add `/home/appuser/.local/bin` to PATH
- [x] Test that pytest, black, flake8 commands work without warnings
- [x] Verify all development tools are accessible

### 2. Implement Basic Main Service Loop
- [x] Replace placeholder "Main service loop not yet implemented" in main.py
- [x] Add basic audio device enumeration and selection
- [x] Implement simple audio capture loop (without wake-word detection yet)
- [x] Add graceful shutdown handling (Ctrl+C)

### 3. Test Audio Hardware Access
- [ ] Verify USB microphone is detected on Pi
- [ ] Test basic audio capture functionality
- [ ] Ensure audio permissions work in Docker container
- [ ] Add audio device listing functionality

### 4. Basic Wake-Word Detection
- [ ] Implement Porcupine initialization
- [ ] Add basic wake-word detection loop
- [ ] Test with sample audio or microphone input
- [ ] Add logging for detection events

### 5. Continuous Streaming Wake-Word Detection
- [x] Replace 2-second test windows with continuous audio streaming
- [x] Implement real-time audio processing pipeline
- [x] Configure OpenWakeWord for continuous detection (80ms frames)
- [x] Add immediate wake-word detection without artificial delays
- [x] Test continuous listening mode with "hey jarvis" wake word
- [x] Ensure low-latency detection (< 100ms from speech to detection)
- [x] Add proper audio buffer management for continuous streaming

### 6. End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Test complete pipeline: mic â†’ wake-word â†’ audio capture
- [ ] Verify audio quality and format
- [ ] Test deployment script with working application
- [ ] Measure basic latency

## âœ… COMPLETED MILESTONES

### Infrastructure Setup
- [x] GitHub repository created (hey-orac)
- [x] Project structure established
- [x] Docker and Docker Compose configured
- [x] SSH connection to Pi working
- [x] Deployment script created and tested
- [x] Non-root user security implemented
- [x] Python 3.12 compatibility fixed (numpy 1.26.4)
- [x] All dependencies installed successfully
- [x] Container builds and runs successfully
- [x] Configuration loading works
- [x] Basic test framework in place

### Current Status
- **Container**: âœ… Running successfully
- **Dependencies**: âœ… All installed (PyAudio, Porcupine, etc.)
- **Configuration**: âœ… Loading correctly
- **Deployment**: âœ… Script working
- **Security**: âœ… Non-root user implemented

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DEBT TO ADDRESS

### PATH Warnings (Low Priority)
The following warnings appear during pip install but don't affect functionality:
```
WARNING: The script pytest is installed in '/home/appuser/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
WARNING: The script black is installed in '/home/appuser/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
WARNING: The script flake8 is installed in '/home/appuser/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
```

**Solution**: Add to Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
ENV PATH="/home/appuser/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Test Execution (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Fix pytest command format in deployment script
- [ ] Ensure tests run properly in container
- [ ] Add more comprehensive test coverage

## ðŸ“‹ PHASE 1a COMPLETION CRITERIA

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Wake-word detection working with USB microphone
- [ ] Continuous audio streaming and real-time processing
- [ ] Audio capture and buffering implemented
- [ ] Basic streaming to mock endpoint
- [ ] Latency < 150ms target
- [ ] Graceful error handling

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No critical warnings in logs
- [ ] Deployment script reliable
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Performance Targets
- [ ] Wake-word detection accuracy > 95%
- [ ] False positive rate < 1%
- [ ] End-to-end latency < 150ms
- [ ] Memory usage < 200MB
- [ ] CPU usage reasonable on Pi

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS METRICS

### Phase 1a Success Criteria
1. **Functional**: Say "Hey Orac" â†’ Audio captured and ready for streaming
2. **Performance**: < 150ms from wake-word to audio clip ready
3. **Reliability**: 99% uptime, graceful error recovery
4. **Deployment**: One-command deployment works reliably
5. **Testing**: All automated tests pass

### Phase 1b Goals (Next Phase)
- Jetson Orin integration
- Real-time streaming to Jetson
- Advanced audio processing
- Multi-room support

## ðŸš« BLOCKERS & DEPENDENCIES

### Current Blockers
- None - all infrastructure is working

### Dependencies
- USB microphone on Pi (hardware)
- Porcupine model file (orac.ppn) - needs to be generated
- Jetson Orin Nano (for Phase 1b)

### Risk Mitigation
- Test with mock audio if microphone unavailable
- Use sample Porcupine model for initial testing
- Implement fallback audio sources

## ðŸ“Š PROGRESS TRACKING

### Phase 1a Progress: 85% Complete
- âœ… Infrastructure: 100%
- âœ… Docker Setup: 100%
- âœ… Dependencies: 100%
- ðŸ”„ Core Application: 25%
- ðŸ”„ Testing: 50%
