# CRITICAL PATH - Hey Orac Voice Control System

## 🎉 MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: PRE-TRAINED WAKE WORD DETECTION WORKING!

### ✅ **CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED: OpenWakeWord Multi-Model Detection Working**

**Status**: **YELLOW** - Pre-trained wake word detection working, but custom wake words failing
**Issue**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED** - OpenWakeWord multi-model detection working for pre-trained models only
**Evidence**: 
- "Hey Jarvis" detected with 89-98% confidence (0.891018 to 0.978833)
- All 10 pre-trained models running simultaneously (alexa, hey_mycroft, hey_jarvis, timers, weather)
- Real confidence scores (not 0.0000) - dynamic range from 0.000001 to 0.978833
- Multiple detections captured and audio clips saved successfully
- System processes audio and detects wake words in real-time
- **6 successful detections in 10 seconds** - excellent responsiveness
- ❌ **CUSTOM WAKE WORDS FAILING**: "Hey Computer" models return 0.0 confidence scores

**Root Cause**: ✅ **FIXED** - Implemented proper OpenWakeWord multi-model approach for pre-trained models
**Impact**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED** - System responds to pre-trained wake words but custom wake words not working
**Priority**: ⚠️ **IN PROGRESS** - Pre-trained wake word detection working, custom wake words need fixing

### 🎯 **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Multi-Model Detection**

**Implementation**: OpenWakeWord now loads ALL available models simultaneously and checks ALL predictions above threshold
**Key Changes**:
- ✅ Model initialization: `openwakeword.Model()` loads all pre-trained models
- ✅ Audio processing: Pass int16 audio directly to `predict()` (documented approach)
- ✅ Detection logic: Check ALL models for detections above threshold
- ✅ Enhanced debugging: Comprehensive logging of prediction_buffer content

**Results**:
- ✅ 10 pre-trained models running: `alexa`, `hey_mycroft`, `hey_jarvis`, `1_minute_timer`, `5_minute_timer`, `10_minute_timer`, `20_minute_timer`, `30_minute_timer`, `1_hour_timer`, `weather`
- ✅ Real confidence scores: 0.000001 to 0.978833 (dynamic range)
- ✅ Proper detection: System detects ANY pre-trained wake word above 0.5 threshold
- ✅ Better debugging: See exactly what's in prediction_buffer and how scores accumulate
- ✅ **High Performance**: 6 detections in 10 seconds = excellent responsiveness
- ❌ **CUSTOM MODELS FAILING**: All custom models return 0.0 confidence scores

**Tagged Version**: `v0.1.0-pre-trained-working` - Working OpenWakeWord implementation for pre-trained models only
