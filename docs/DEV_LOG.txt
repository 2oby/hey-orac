# Development Log - pi-wakeword-streamer

## 2025-01-XX - Project Initialization
- [ ] Project outline created and reviewed
- [ ] Critical path defined for Phase 1a
- [ ] Development environment setup planned
- [ ] GitHub repository structure designed

## 2025-07-04 - Audio Device Integration Progress

### âœ… COMPLETED TODAY
- [x] Fixed CPU runaway loop in main.py (added sleep to prevent 100% CPU usage)
- [x] Created audio_utils.py module with AudioManager class for device management
- [x] Implemented audio device listing functionality in main.py
- [x] Separated production and development requirements (removed black/flake8 from container)
- [x] Updated docker-compose.yml with audio device mounting and ALSA configuration
- [x] Successfully deployed to Raspberry Pi (niederpi at 192.168.8.99)
- [x] USB microphone plugged in and ready for testing
- [x] **ðŸŽ‰ USB MICROPHONE RECORDING WORKING!** - Successfully recorded 3-second test file
- [x] Added `--test-recording` functionality to main.py
- [x] Cleaned up temporary development files

### ðŸ”§ CURRENT STATUS
- **Container**: âœ… Running successfully with sleep fix
- **Audio Device Access**: âœ… Working with ALSA warnings (expected)
- **USB Microphone**: âœ… Detected and recording working!
- **Deployment**: âœ… Working via `./scripts/deploy_and_test.sh "commit message"`

### ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (for next LLM)

#### 1. Test USB Recording (COMPLETED âœ…)
```bash
# Test recording from USB microphone
ssh pi 'cd ~/hey-orac && docker-compose exec -T hey-orac python src/main.py --test-recording'
```

#### 2. Next Phase: Wake-Word Detection
- Implement Porcupine wake-word detection
- Test with "Hey Orac" wake word
- Integrate with audio recording pipeline

#### 3. Audio Streaming to Jetson
- Implement HTTP streaming to Jetson Orin
- Test end-to-end audio pipeline
- Add error handling and retry logic

### ðŸ“‹ TECHNICAL CONTEXT FOR NEXT LLM

#### SSH Access
- **Pi Hostname**: niederpi
- **IP Address**: 192.168.8.99
- **User**: 2oby
- **SSH Alias**: `ssh pi` (configured in ~/.ssh/config)
- **Project Path**: `/home/2oby/hey-orac/`

#### Deployment Process
```bash
# Always use descriptive commit message
./scripts/deploy_and_test.sh "Your descriptive commit message here"

# The script will:
# 1. Commit and push changes to GitHub
# 2. SSH to Pi and pull latest code
# 3. Build and start Docker containers
# 4. Run automated tests
# 5. Report results
```

#### Docker Container Access
```bash
# Execute commands in running container
ssh pi 'cd ~/hey-orac && docker-compose exec -T hey-orac python src/main.py --list-devices'

# View container logs
ssh pi 'cd ~/hey-orac && docker-compose logs -f hey-orac'

# Stop/restart container
ssh pi 'cd ~/hey-orac && docker-compose restart hey-orac'
```

#### Audio Device Issues
- **Problem**: Container can't access host audio devices
- **Solution**: Added audio group permissions and ALSA config mounting
- **Test**: Use `arecord -l` on host to verify USB microphone is detected
- **Next**: Test device listing in container after deployment

#### File Structure
- `src/main.py` - Main application with device listing and recording test
- `src/audio_utils.py` - Audio device management utilities
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container configuration with audio mounts
- `requirements.txt` - Production dependencies only
- `requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies (black, flake8)

### ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR NEXT PHASE
1. **USB microphone detected** in container device listing âœ…
2. **Basic recording test** working (3-second test recording) âœ…
3. **No ALSA errors** in container logs âœ… (warnings are expected)
4. **Audio file saved** and playable âœ…

### ðŸŽ¯ NEXT PHASE SUCCESS CRITERIA
1. **Wake-word detection** working with "Hey Orac"
2. **Audio streaming** to Jetson Orin endpoint
3. **End-to-end pipeline** from microphone to speech processing
4. **Error handling** and retry logic implemented

### ðŸš« KNOWN ISSUES
- ALSA configuration warnings in container (expected, doesn't affect functionality)
- ~~Container needs audio group permissions~~ âœ… FIXED
- ~~USB microphone not yet detected~~ âœ… FIXED
