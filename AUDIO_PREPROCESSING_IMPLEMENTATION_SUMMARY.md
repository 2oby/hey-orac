# Audio Preprocessing Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive audio preprocessing pipeline for the Hey Orac project to improve audio quality before sending to the ORAC STT service. The implementation addresses the key issues identified in the analysis:

1. **Audio clipping at high volumes**
2. **Lack of automatic gain control (AGC)**
3. **Missing dynamic range compression**
4. **Late normalization in the pipeline**

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Preprocessing Module (`audio/preprocessor.py`)

Created a full-featured audio preprocessor with:

- **Automatic Gain Control (AGC)**: Normalizes audio levels to a target RMS
- **Dynamic Range Compression**: Reduces volume variations with configurable ratio
- **Peak Limiting**: Prevents clipping with soft limiting
- **Noise Gate**: Optional low-level noise reduction
- **Real-time Metrics**: Tracks gain, peak levels, and clipping

Key features:
- Configurable parameters for all processing stages
- Smooth attack/release envelopes for AGC
- Soft-knee compression for natural sound
- Lookahead limiting to prevent harsh clipping

### 2. Enhanced Ring Buffer (`audio/ring_buffer.py`)

Updated to support both int16 and float32 formats:
- Automatic format conversion when writing/reading
- Backward compatibility with `read_last_as_int16()`
- Efficient numpy-based storage

### 3. Integrated Microphone Module (`audio/microphone.py`)

Modified AudioCapture class to:
- Apply preprocessing immediately after capture
- Convert to float32 early in the pipeline
- Store preprocessed audio in the ring buffer
- Provide audio quality metrics

### 4. Updated Speech Recorder (`audio/speech_recorder.py`)

- Removed redundant normalization (audio already preprocessed)
- Pre-roll audio is now already enhanced
- Added notes for future integration improvements

### 5. Configuration Support

Added comprehensive audio preprocessing settings to:
- `config/settings.json.template`: Default preprocessing parameters
- `config/manager.py`: Support for nested preprocessing configuration

Default settings:
```json
"preprocessing": {
  "enable_agc": true,
  "agc_target_level": 0.3,
  "agc_max_gain": 10.0,
  "enable_compression": true,
  "compression_ratio": 4.0,
  "enable_limiter": true,
  "limiter_threshold": 0.95
}
```

### 6. Integration Helper (`wake_word_detection_preprocessing.py`)

Created helper functions to simplify integration:
- `initialize_audio_capture_with_preprocessing()`: Sets up AudioCapture with preprocessing
- `get_preprocessed_audio_chunk()`: Handles both microphone and WAV file input
- `update_audio_metrics()`: Updates shared data with audio quality metrics

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistent Audio Levels**: AGC ensures stable volume regardless of speaker distance
2. **No Clipping**: Peak limiting prevents distortion at high volumes
3. **Improved STT Accuracy**: Clean, normalized audio improves transcription
4. **Better Dynamic Range**: Compression makes quiet and loud speech more uniform
5. **Real-time Monitoring**: Audio metrics help diagnose issues

## Integration Notes

The implementation is designed to be minimally invasive:
- Preprocessing is optional and configurable
- Maintains compatibility with existing features (WAV input, recording mode)
- Can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- No changes required to OpenWakeWord integration

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various speaking volumes (whisper to shout)
2. Test at different distances from microphone
3. Compare STT accuracy with/without preprocessing
4. Monitor audio metrics for clipping and gain adjustments
5. Test with background noise to evaluate noise gate

## Future Enhancements

1. Add spectral noise reduction
2. Implement de-essing for harsh sibilants
3. Add configurable high-pass filter
4. Create audio quality scoring system
5. Add real-time visualization of preprocessing effects

## Conclusion

The audio preprocessing implementation provides a robust foundation for improving audio quality in the Hey Orac system. It addresses all identified issues while maintaining flexibility and backward compatibility. The modular design allows for easy testing and future enhancements.
