# Wake Word Detection Fix Plan

## Problem: Very Low Confidence Scores (0.000001-0.000005)
The current implementation is getting extremely low confidence scores even with clear speech, indicating fundamental audio processing or model loading issues.

## Analysis of OLD WORKING FILES vs CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION

### Key Differences Found:
1. **Audio Normalization**: Current uses `/32767.0`, old working code uses `/32768.0`
2. **Model Architecture**: Current uses simple direct OpenWakeWord, old uses sophisticated WakeWordDetector interface
3. **Custom Model Support**: Current only loads pre-trained models, old supports custom models  
4. **Audio Processing**: Current has basic processing, old has sophisticated buffering and preprocessing
5. **Threshold Management**: Current artificially lowered thresholds suggest fundamental issues

## 5 POSSIBLE CAUSES & FIX PLANS

### CAUSE 1: Audio Normalization Error ‚úÖ TESTED - MINIMAL IMPACT
**Issue**: Current code divides by 32767.0, but old working code divides by 32768.0
**Impact**: Audio amplitude scaling affects model input quality
**Plan**: Fix audio normalization in wake_word_detection.py  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Changed /32767.0 to /32768.0, but confidence scores still extremely low
**Result**: No significant improvement - confidence scores still 0.000001-0.000005

### CAUSE 2: Missing Custom Model Loading ‚ùå NOT APPLICABLE ‚úÖ  
**Issue**: Current code only loads pre-trained models, not custom models from third_party/
**Impact**: May not have the right models for detection
**Plan**: Add custom model loading capability
**Status**: ‚úÖ ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Not the issue since pre-trained models should work

### CAUSE 3: Model Initialization Issues ‚úÖ RULED OUT
**Issue**: Current model initialization may not be loading models properly
**Impact**: Models may not be ready for prediction  
**Plan**: Improve model initialization with better error checking and logging
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Models are working perfectly!
**Result**: Enhanced logging confirms all 11 models load correctly, test prediction works, prediction buffer populates properly

### CAUSE 4: Audio Stream Format Issues ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: Audio stream parameters or data format may be incompatible with models
**Impact**: Poor quality audio input to models
**Plan**: Verify and fix audio stream configuration
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Fixed stereo microphone handling with proper stereo‚Üímono conversion
**Result**: Audio processing now correct (5120 bytes‚Üí2560 samples‚Üí1280 mono samples), but confidence scores still extremely low

### CAUSE 5: Missing Audio Preprocessing üîÑ CRITICAL INVESTIGATION  
**Issue**: Current code lacks sophisticated audio preprocessing from old implementation
**Impact**: Raw audio may need additional processing for optimal model performance
**Plan**: Implement proper audio preprocessing pipeline  
**Status**: üîÑ INVESTIGATING - All basic issues fixed, but confidence scores still 100,000x too low
**Critical Finding**: Confidence scores 0.000005 vs needed 0.5 - suggests fundamental preprocessing issue

## PROGRESS LOG

### 2025-07-15 18:45 - Analysis Complete
- ‚úÖ Examined OLD WORKING FILES vs current implementation
- ‚úÖ Identified 5 potential root causes
- ‚úÖ Created systematic fix plan
- üîÑ Starting with audio normalization fix (easiest to test)

### 2025-07-15 19:00 - Systematic Testing Completed
- ‚úÖ **CAUSE 1**: Audio normalization fixed (/32767.0 ‚Üí /32768.0) - minimal impact
- ‚úÖ **CAUSE 2**: Custom models not needed - pre-trained models sufficient  
- ‚úÖ **CAUSE 3**: Model initialization enhanced - all 11 models loading perfectly
- ‚úÖ **CAUSE 4**: Audio format fixed - stereo microphone now properly converted to mono
- üîç **CAUSE 5**: All technical issues resolved, but confidence scores still 100,000x too low

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Technical Setup**: Models load correctly, audio streams properly, stereo‚Üímono conversion working
- ‚úÖ **Audio Processing**: Correct format (1280 samples), reasonable volume levels (0.0001-0.0022)  
- ‚ùå **Confidence Scores**: Extremely low (0.000001-0.000005) vs required threshold (0.5)
- üéØ **Next Step**: Ready for live wake word testing - need human speech to test actual detection

### Next: Test with actual wake words when user is ready
