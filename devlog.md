# Hey ORAC Wake-Word Module Development Log

## 2025-07-15 18:30 - Initial Project Setup
- Created project structure for minimal OpenWakeWord test on Raspberry Pi
- Set up requirements.txt with OpenWakeWord==0.6.0 and audio dependencies
- Created Dockerfile for Raspberry Pi with ALSA audio support
- Created docker-compose.yml with audio device access and privileged mode
- Updated deploy_and_test.sh script for WakeWordTest project

## 2025-07-15 18:35 - Git Repository Setup
- Initialized git repository in WakeWordTest directory
- Created wake-word-test branch in hey-orac repository
- Successfully pushed initial implementation to GitHub
- Fixed SSH authentication issues and used stored credentials

## 2025-07-15 18:45 - First Deployment Attempt
- Successfully deployed to Raspberry Pi via deploy script
- Container built successfully and detected USB microphone (SH-04)
- Identified NumPy compatibility issue with OpenWakeWord/tflite-runtime
- Fixed NumPy version constraint to <2.0.0,>=1.21.0

## 2025-07-15 18:50 - Successful Container Launch
- Container now starts successfully with correct dependencies
- USB microphone properly detected: SH-04: USB Audio (hw:2,0)
- Audio stream creation successful with 16kHz, mono audio
- OpenWakeWord models loaded: alexa, hey_mycroft, hey_jarvis, hey_rhasspy, timer, weather

## 2025-07-15 18:55 - Detection Loop Issue Identified
- Container running but wake word detection loop not starting
- Script hangs after "OpenWakeWord model initialized" message
- Added debug logging and lowered detection threshold to 0.3 for testing
- Attempted various fixes for logging buffering issues

## 2025-07-15 19:00 - Debugging Efforts
- Confirmed Model() creation works fine when tested directly (0.23s)
- Issue appears to be script hanging after model initialization
- Tried unbuffered output, forced log flushing, and stream testing
- Current status: Container healthy, audio accessible, but main detection loop not executing

## 2025-07-15 19:10 - BREAKTHROUGH: Wake Word Detection Loop Working!
- **Root cause identified**: Unbuffered I/O code was causing ValueError preventing script execution
- **Fix applied**: Replaced `sys.stdout = os.fdopen(sys.stdout.fileno(), 'w', 0)` with `os.environ['PYTHONUNBUFFERED'] = '1'`
- **Result**: Script now executes completely through detection loop
- **Current status**: 
  - ‚úÖ Container builds and runs successfully
  - ‚úÖ USB microphone detection working
  - ‚úÖ Audio stream creation successful (2560 bytes per read)
  - ‚úÖ OpenWakeWord model initialization working
  - ‚úÖ Main detection loop processing audio chunks (200+ processed)
  - ‚úÖ Audio volume detection working (0.0001-0.0002 levels)

## 2025-07-15 20:06 - Systematic Wake Word Detection Fixes Completed
- **Issue**: Very low confidence scores (0.000001-0.000005) preventing wake word detection
- **Analysis**: Compared OLD WORKING FILES with current implementation to identify root causes
- **Fixes Applied**:
  1. ‚úÖ **Audio Normalization**: Changed `/32767.0` to `/32768.0` (minimal impact)
  2. ‚úÖ **Model Initialization**: Enhanced model testing and verification (working perfectly)
  3. ‚úÖ **Audio Format**: Fixed stereo microphone handling - now properly converts stereo‚Üímono
  4. ‚úÖ **Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging for model and audio processing
- **Current Status**: All technical issues resolved, system ready for testing

## Current State
- ‚úÖ Docker container building and running successfully
- ‚úÖ USB microphone detection and audio stream creation (stereo SH-04)
- ‚úÖ OpenWakeWord model loading (11 models: alexa, hey_mycroft, hey_jarvis, hey_rhasspy, timers, weather)
- ‚úÖ Audio processing: Stereo‚Üímono conversion working (5120 bytes‚Üí2560 samples‚Üí1280 mono samples)
- ‚úÖ Main wake word detection loop executing and processing audio correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confidence scores still extremely low (0.000005 vs needed 0.5) with ambient audio
- üéØ **READY FOR TESTING**: System technically sound, needs actual wake word testing with human speech

## 2025-07-17 - M0 Project Bootstrap Completed
- **Objective**: Restructure project following Technical Design specification
- **Key Changes**:
  1. ‚úÖ Created proper Python package structure (src/hey_orac/ with submodules)
  2. ‚úÖ Set up modern Python packaging with pyproject.toml
  3. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive .gitignore file
  4. ‚úÖ Created GitHub Actions CI workflow for testing and Docker builds
  5. ‚úÖ Set up pytest infrastructure with fixtures
  6. ‚úÖ Updated Dockerfile to multi-stage build with Python 3.11
  7. ‚úÖ Created README.md with project documentation
  8. ‚úÖ Added CLI entry point (hey-orac command)
  9. ‚úÖ Created configuration template (settings.json.template)
- **Project Structure Now Matches Technical Design**:
  ```
