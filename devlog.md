# Hey ORAC Wake-Word Module Development Log

## 2025-07-15 18:30 - Initial Project Setup
- Created project structure for minimal OpenWakeWord test on Raspberry Pi
- Set up requirements.txt with OpenWakeWord==0.6.0 and audio dependencies
- Created Dockerfile for Raspberry Pi with ALSA audio support
- Created docker-compose.yml with audio device access and privileged mode
- Updated deploy_and_test.sh script for WakeWordTest project

## 2025-07-15 18:35 - Git Repository Setup
- Initialized git repository in WakeWordTest directory
- Created wake-word-test branch in hey-orac repository
- Successfully pushed initial implementation to GitHub
- Fixed SSH authentication issues and used stored credentials

## 2025-07-15 18:45 - First Deployment Attempt
- Successfully deployed to Raspberry Pi via deploy script
- Container built successfully and detected USB microphone (SH-04)
- Identified NumPy compatibility issue with OpenWakeWord/tflite-runtime
- Fixed NumPy version constraint to <2.0.0,>=1.21.0

## 2025-07-15 18:50 - Successful Container Launch
- Container now starts successfully with correct dependencies
- USB microphone properly detected: SH-04: USB Audio (hw:2,0)
- Audio stream creation successful with 16kHz, mono audio
- OpenWakeWord models loaded: alexa, hey_mycroft, hey_jarvis, hey_rhasspy, timer, weather

## 2025-07-15 18:55 - Detection Loop Issue Identified
- Container running but wake word detection loop not starting
- Script hangs after "OpenWakeWord model initialized" message
- Added debug logging and lowered detection threshold to 0.3 for testing
- Attempted various fixes for logging buffering issues

## 2025-07-15 19:00 - Debugging Efforts
- Confirmed Model() creation works fine when tested directly (0.23s)
- Issue appears to be script hanging after model initialization
- Tried unbuffered output, forced log flushing, and stream testing
- Current status: Container healthy, audio accessible, but main detection loop not executing

## 2025-07-15 19:10 - BREAKTHROUGH: Wake Word Detection Loop Working!
- **Root cause identified**: Unbuffered I/O code was causing ValueError preventing script execution
- **Fix applied**: Replaced `sys.stdout = os.fdopen(sys.stdout.fileno(), 'w', 0)` with `os.environ['PYTHONUNBUFFERED'] = '1'`
- **Result**: Script now executes completely through detection loop
- **Current status**: 
  - ‚úÖ Container builds and runs successfully
  - ‚úÖ USB microphone detection working
  - ‚úÖ Audio stream creation successful (2560 bytes per read)
  - ‚úÖ OpenWakeWord model initialization working
  - ‚úÖ Main detection loop processing audio chunks (200+ processed)
  - ‚úÖ Audio volume detection working (0.0001-0.0002 levels)

## 2025-07-15 20:06 - Systematic Wake Word Detection Fixes Completed
- **Issue**: Very low confidence scores (0.000001-0.000005) preventing wake word detection
- **Analysis**: Compared OLD WORKING FILES with current implementation to identify root causes
- **Fixes Applied**:
  1. ‚úÖ **Audio Normalization**: Changed `/32767.0` to `/32768.0` (minimal impact)
  2. ‚úÖ **Model Initialization**: Enhanced model testing and verification (working perfectly)
  3. ‚úÖ **Audio Format**: Fixed stereo microphone handling - now properly converts stereo‚Üímono
  4. ‚úÖ **Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging for model and audio processing
- **Current Status**: All technical issues resolved, system ready for testing

## Current State
- ‚úÖ Docker container building and running successfully
- ‚úÖ USB microphone detection and audio stream creation (stereo SH-04)
- ‚úÖ OpenWakeWord model loading (11 models: alexa, hey_mycroft, hey_jarvis, hey_rhasspy, timers, weather)
- ‚úÖ Audio processing: Stereo‚Üímono conversion working (5120 bytes‚Üí2560 samples‚Üí1280 mono samples)
- ‚úÖ Main wake word detection loop executing and processing audio correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confidence scores still extremely low (0.000005 vs needed 0.5) with ambient audio
- üéØ **READY FOR TESTING**: System technically sound, needs actual wake word testing with human speech

## 2025-07-17 - M0 Project Bootstrap Completed
