# Current Focus: Code Cleanup Sprint COMPLETED âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ Successfully Consolidated Wake Word Detection

### Accomplishments:

#### âœ… Code Consolidation Complete
- Ported custom model loading from test pipeline to main detection loop
- Added `--input-wav` flag for WAV file input (feeds into main loop)
- Added `--use-custom-model` flag to use Hay--compUta_v_lrg.tflite
- Implemented WavFileStream class for seamless WAV file processing
- Maintained all existing functionality (recording, test pipeline, live detection)

#### âœ… File Cleanup Complete
- Deleted: `wake_word_detection_custom (conflicted).py`
- Renamed with LEGACY_ prefix:
  - LEGACY_wake_word_detection_enhanced.py
  - LEGACY_wake_word_detection_custom.py
  - LEGACY_test_custom_model.py
  - LEGACY_test_m1.py
  - LEGACY_test_tflite_integration.py

#### âœ… Testing Complete
- WAV input tested successfully with custom model
- Detection working at 19.96% confidence (same as before)
- Dynamic threshold adjustment (0.05 for custom, 0.3 for built-in)
- Stereo-to-mono conversion verified
- WAV file looping functionality confirmed

### Technical Fixes Applied:
- Updated docker-compose.yml to mount src and models directories as volumes
- Fixed UnboundLocalError by removing duplicate 'import os' in main function
- Fixed argument parser to accept both hyphen and underscore formats

### Current Status:
- âœ… Consolidated script fully functional and tested
- âœ… Live microphone testing SUCCESSFUL with custom model
- âœ… Production-level performance achieved: **92.54% confidence**
- âœ… Ready for production deployment

## Live Testing Results (COMPLETED):
- **Custom Model**: Hay--compUta_v_lrg.tflite working perfectly
- **Live Detection**: 92.54% confidence (vs 19.96% from recordings)
- **Performance**: Multiple detections with high accuracy
- **Git Tag**: v0.1.2 created to mark this milestone

## Next Steps:
1. âœ… Test live microphone detection with custom model - **COMPLETED**
2. âœ… Update CLAUDE.md documentation - **COMPLETED** 
3. Move to production deployment phase

### Key Achievement:
All wake word detection functionality is now consolidated into a single `wake_word_detection.py` script with proper command-line switches, making it ready for GUI integration where model selection and thresholds will be managed.
