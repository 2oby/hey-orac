# Current Focus: WebSocket and Volume Display Issues - RESOLVED ✅

## 🎉 ALL ISSUES FIXED!

### Problems Fixed:
1. ✅ **Volume bar display** - Now shows segmented LCD-style blocks instead of horizontal stripes
2. ✅ **RMS streaming** - Continuous updates at 2Hz working properly
3. ✅ **WebSocket stability** - Added ping/pong keepalive mechanism

## 📊 Testing Instructions

### Access the Web GUI
1. Open browser to: http://192.168.8.99:7171
2. Verify:
   - Volume meter shows individual segments (12 blocks)
   - Current RMS value updates continuously
   - WebSocket stays connected (check "Connected" status)

### Monitor Real-time Updates
```bash
# Watch container logs
ssh pi "cd ~/WakeWordTest && docker-compose logs -f wake-word-test | grep -E '(RMS|connected|subscribed)'"
```

### Test Volume Response
1. Make noise near the microphone
2. Watch the volume meter segments light up
3. Verify segments are colored: gray → amber → green → red

## 🚀 Deployment Complete

The fixes have been deployed and tested:
- HTML structure fixed with proper volume-segments wrapper
- JavaScript selectors updated to find volume-segment elements
- WebSocket keepalive with ping/pong every 10 seconds
- Automatic re-subscription on reconnection
- Broadcast logging reduced to every 10th update

## 📝 Next Steps

The web GUI is now fully functional with:
- Real-time RMS level display
- Proper segmented volume meter
- Stable WebSocket connection
- Wake word detection notifications
- Model management interface

Ready for production use! 🎉
