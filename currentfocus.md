# Current Focus: Settings Manager Testing & Validation

## ðŸ§ª IMMEDIATE TASKS: Settings Persistence Testing

### Test Requirements
1. **GUIâ†’Config**: Verify settings changed in web interface are saved to config file
2. **Config Persistence**: Verify saved settings survive application restart  
3. **Configâ†’GUI**: Verify saved settings are loaded correctly into web interface on startup
4. **End-to-End**: Complete workflow test (change setting â†’ save â†’ restart â†’ verify loaded)

### Testing Plan
- [ ] Examine current settings manager implementation
- [ ] Identify testable settings (threshold, models, etc.)
- [ ] Test GUI setting changes trigger config file updates
- [ ] Test config file changes persist through container restart
- [ ] Test config file values populate GUI correctly on startup
- [ ] Fix any identified issues in the settings persistence chain

# Previous Focus: Wake Word Detection System Operational

## âœ… LATEST UPDATE: Logging Verbosity Fixed (2025-07-20)

### Problem Solved
- **Issue**: Excessive Socket.IO logging appearing twice per second
- **Root Cause**: Main logging level set to DEBUG + engineio.server logging not silenced
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Changed main logging level from DEBUG to INFO in `wake_word_detection.py:31`
  - Added explicit silencing of engineio.server and socketio.server loggers to WARNING level
  - Deployed and verified logs are now clean with only periodic status updates

### Result
âœ… Logs now show only relevant information every ~8 seconds instead of constant RMS broadcasts
âœ… Container performance improved with reduced log overhead
âœ… Debugging information still available but not overwhelming

---

## ðŸŽ¯ System Status: STABLE

### Current Capabilities Working:
- âœ… Docker deployment via deploy_and_test.sh
- âœ… Audio capture and processing
- âœ… Wake word detection (hey_jarvis model)
- âœ… Web interface with real-time RMS display
- âœ… WebSocket streaming (RMS updates, detection events)
- âœ… Clean, appropriate logging levels

### Recent Fixes Completed:
1. **WebSocket Streaming**: Fixed by removing eventlet, using threading mode
2. **Docker Build Caching**: Resolved container running old code issues
3. **Audio Processing**: Stereoâ†’Mono conversion working correctly
4. **Model Loading**: NumPy compatibility and model initialization fixed
5. **Logging Verbosity**: Reduced excessive Socket.IO debug messages

## ðŸ”„ Ready for Next Development Phase

The system is now stable and ready for:
- Custom model testing
- Speech capture implementation
- Additional wake word models
- Performance optimizations
- Feature enhancements

**No critical issues currently blocking development.**
