- **TFLite optimization confirmed**: Using XNNPACK delegate for ARM64 performance
- **Detection verified**: Successfully detected "Hey Computer" phrase in recorded audio
- **Best performing model identified**: `Hay--compUta_v_lrg.tflite` shows highest sensitivity

### 🚀 **Next Phase: M3 - Model Performance Analysis**

## 🎯 Current Focus: M3 - Individual Model Performance Testing

### Implementation Tasks for M3:
1. **Individual Model Testing** - Test each custom model separately with recorded audio
   - Create script to test `Hay--compUta_v_lrg.tflite` individually
   - Create script to test `Hey_computer.tflite` individually  
   - Create script to test `hey-CompUter_lrg.tflite` individually
   - Record confidence scores for each model across the entire audio clip
   - Generate detailed confidence score timelines for comparison

2. **Comparative Analysis** - Analyze detection scores and model characteristics
   - Compare peak confidence scores between models
   - Identify optimal detection thresholds for each model
   - Analyze response timing differences
   - Document model sensitivity characteristics

3. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize detection parameters
   - Test different detection thresholds (0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3)
   - Measure false positive rates
   - Optimize for best balance of sensitivity vs specificity
   - Document recommended thresholds per model

4. **Model Selection** - Determine best performing model
   - Compare detection accuracy across models
   - Evaluate processing speed differences
   - Test with additional audio samples if available
   - Make recommendation for production use

### Success Criteria for M3:
- ✅ Individual confidence scores recorded for each model
- ✅ Comparative analysis completed with detailed metrics
- ✅ Optimal detection thresholds identified for each model
- ✅ Best performing model selected for production use
- ✅ Performance characteristics documented

### Next Immediate Steps:
1. **Create individual model test scripts** for each of the three models
2. **Run detailed confidence analysis** on the recorded "Hey Computer" audio
3. **Compare detection scores** and identify peak responses
4. **Optimize detection thresholds** based on model performance

#### Completed Implementation Tasks for M2:
1. **✅ Created SettingsManager** class (src/hey_orac/config/manager.py)
   - JSON schema validation with comprehensive schema
   - Atomic file writes with tempfile for safety
   - Change notification system with callbacks
   - Thread-safe get/update methods with RLock

2. **✅ Implemented ModelManager** (src/hey_orac/models/manager.py)
   - Dynamic model loading/unloading with TFLite optimization
   - Support for ONNX and TFLite formats (prioritizing TFLite for Pi)
   - Hot-reload without restart using file checksums
   - Model file validation and error handling

3. **✅ Created Configuration Schema**
   - Defined comprehensive JSON schema for settings validation
   - Created settings.json template in config/ directory
   - Validation on load and update with detailed error messages

4. **✅ Added Metrics Collection**
   - TFLite-specific performance monitoring (src/hey_orac/metrics/)
   - Inference time tracking with sliding window averages
   - Model performance metrics (load time, size, format)
   - System resource usage (CPU, memory, temperature, throttling)
   - Raspberry Pi specific metrics (temperature, throttling state)

5. **✅ Integration Testing**
   - Created comprehensive integration test suite (src/test_tflite_integration.py)
   - Tests model swapping and hot-reload functionality
   - Verifies no audio interruption during model changes
   - Performance monitoring validation

#### ✅ Additional TFLite Optimizations Implemented:
- **ARM64 Compatibility**: Fixed tflite-runtime dependency for Raspberry Pi
- **Enhanced Wake Word Detector**: Created wake_word_detection_enhanced.py with all new features
- **Performance Monitoring**: Added psutil dependency for system metrics
- **Hot-Reload Architecture**: Background thread monitoring for config/model changes
- **Thread Safety**: All components use proper locking mechanisms
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation

## Next Steps: M3 - Deployment and Testing
1. **Deploy TFLite implementation to Raspberry Pi**
   - Test enhanced wake word detector on Pi
   - Verify TFLite performance optimization
   - Monitor system resource usage
   - Test hot-reload functionality

2. **Performance Validation**
   - Measure inference times on Pi hardware
   - Compare TFLite vs ONNX performance
   - Validate temperature and throttling monitoring
   - Test under various system loads

3. **Custom Model Testing**
   - Test loading custom TFLite models

- ✅ Settings persist across restarts
- ✅ Metrics available at /metrics endpoint
- ✅ No audio processing interruption during reload

## Technical Notes
- Current deployment shows TensorFlow dependency issues on ARM64
- May need to handle tflite-runtime installation separately
- Consider using model file checksums for change detection
- Ensure thread safety during model swapping
