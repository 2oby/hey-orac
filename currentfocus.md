# Current Focus: Settings Manager Implementation & Testing

## ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE TASKS: Fix Settings Persistence Chain

### Critical Issues Identified (Analysis Complete âœ…)
1. **Missing Backend Methods**: Routes call non-existent SettingsManager methods
2. **Schema Mismatches**: Frontend expects system config fields not in schema  
3. **API Integration Gap**: No persistence methods for GUI settings

### Implementation Tasks
- [x] Examine current settings manager implementation
- [x] Identify testable settings and missing methods
- [ ] **IN PROGRESS**: Add missing methods to SettingsManager class
- [ ] Test GUI setting changes trigger config file updates
- [ ] Test config file changes persist through container restart
- [ ] Test config file values populate GUI correctly on startup
- [ ] End-to-end validation: change â†’ save â†’ restart â†’ verify

### Missing Methods to Implement
```python
def update_model_config(self, model_name: str, **updates) -> bool
def update_system_config(self, **updates) -> bool  
def save(self) -> bool  # convenience method
```

### Missing SystemConfig Fields
```python
rms_filter: float = 50.0
cooldown: float = 2.0
```

# Previous Focus: Wake Word Detection System Operational (v0.1.4 âœ…)

## âœ… LATEST UPDATE: Logging Verbosity Fixed (2025-07-20)

### Problem Solved
- **Issue**: Excessive Socket.IO logging appearing twice per second
- **Root Cause**: Main logging level set to DEBUG + engineio.server logging not silenced
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Changed main logging level from DEBUG to INFO in `wake_word_detection.py:31`
  - Added explicit silencing of engineio.server and socketio.server loggers to WARNING level
  - Deployed and verified logs are now clean with only periodic status updates

### Result
âœ… Logs now show only relevant information every ~8 seconds instead of constant RMS broadcasts
âœ… Container performance improved with reduced log overhead
âœ… Debugging information still available but not overwhelming

---

## ðŸŽ¯ System Status: STABLE

### Current Capabilities Working:
- âœ… Docker deployment via deploy_and_test.sh
- âœ… Audio capture and processing
- âœ… Wake word detection (hey_jarvis model)
- âœ… Web interface with real-time RMS display
- âœ… WebSocket streaming (RMS updates, detection events)
- âœ… Clean, appropriate logging levels

### Recent Fixes Completed:
1. **WebSocket Streaming**: Fixed by removing eventlet, using threading mode
2. **Docker Build Caching**: Resolved container running old code issues
3. **Audio Processing**: Stereoâ†’Mono conversion working correctly
4. **Model Loading**: NumPy compatibility and model initialization fixed
5. **Logging Verbosity**: Reduced excessive Socket.IO debug messages

## ðŸ”„ Ready for Next Development Phase

The system is now stable and ready for:
- Custom model testing
- Speech capture implementation
- Additional wake word models
- Performance optimizations
- Feature enhancements

**No critical issues currently blocking development.**
