# Current Focus: Wake Word Detection Loop Not Starting

## Problem
The OpenWakeWord container starts successfully, but the main wake word detection loop never begins execution. The script hangs after "OpenWakeWord model initialized" message.

## What's Working
- ✅ Docker container builds and runs successfully
- ✅ USB microphone (SH-04) detected correctly
- ✅ Audio stream creation successful
- ✅ OpenWakeWord model loading (6 models: alexa, hey_mycroft, hey_jarvis, hey_rhasspy, timer, weather)
- ✅ Container health checks passing

## Current Investigation
1. **Debug prints not appearing**: Added extensive debug print statements but they're not showing in logs
2. **Model creation timing**: Direct Model() test works fine (0.23s), but hangs in main script
3. **Code deployment verification**: Need to confirm debug code is actually in running container

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Verify the latest code changes are actually deployed in the container
2. Check if there's a Docker layer caching issue preventing code updates
3. Test running the script manually inside the container to see raw output
4. Consider the possibility that logging is being redirected or buffered differently

## Key Debugging Points
- Script execution stops after line: `logger.info("OpenWakeWord model initialized")`
- No debug prints appear despite being added with `flush=True`
- Container remains healthy and responsive
- High CPU usage (18%) suggests tight loop or blocking operation
