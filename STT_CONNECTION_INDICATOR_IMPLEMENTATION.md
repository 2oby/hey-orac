# STT Connection Indicator Implementation Guide

## ✅ COMPLETED - 2025-08-21

This feature has been successfully implemented and deployed.

## Overview
Added a visual STT connection status indicator to the Hey ORAC web interface footer. This indicator shows the health status of all configured webhook URLs for STT services.

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Implemented:
1. **HTML Structure** - Added new status item in footer with indicator dot and "STT: Status" text
2. **CSS Styling** - Three states supported:
   - Green (default) - All STT endpoints healthy  
   - Orange (.partial class) - Some STT endpoints healthy
   - Red (.error class) - No STT endpoints healthy or none configured
3. **Health Check Logic** - `check_all_stt_health()` function that aggregates health from all webhook URLs
4. **WebSocket Updates** - Added `stt_health` field to status broadcasts
5. **JavaScript Handler** - `updateSTTStatus()` function updates indicator color and text
6. **Periodic Health Checks** - Runs every 30 seconds automatically
7. **Immediate Status Updates** - New clients receive status immediately upon connection

### Key Files Modified:
- `/src/hey_orac/web/static/index.html` - Added STT status item in footer
- `/src/hey_orac/web/static/css/style.css` - Added .partial class for orange state
- `/src/hey_orac/wake_word_detection.py` - Added health check aggregation function
- `/src/hey_orac/web/broadcaster.py` - Added stt_health to status broadcasts
- `/src/hey_orac/web/routes.py` - Send immediate status on client subscribe
- `/src/hey_orac/web/static/js/main.js` - Added updateSTTStatus() handler
- `/src/hey_orac/transport/stt_client.py` - Fixed health check to accept 'initializing' status

### Important Fix Applied:
The ORAC STT service returns `status: 'initializing'` when starting up or between requests. The health check was updated to accept 'initializing', 'ready', or 'healthy' as valid states, ensuring the indicator shows green when the service is accessible.

## Success Criteria Met:
- ✅ Indicator appears in footer with consistent styling
- ✅ Shows green when all STT endpoints are healthy
- ✅ Shows orange when some endpoints are healthy (ready for testing)
- ✅ Shows red when no endpoints are healthy or none configured
- ✅ Updates in real-time as health status changes
- ✅ No impact on wake word detection performance

## Testing Results:
- Deployed to Raspberry Pi successfully
- STT indicator correctly shows green when ORAC STT service is online
- Health status updates propagate through WebSocket to web interface
- No performance impact observed

## Repository Status:
All changes have been committed and pushed to the master branch.
