# Audio Preprocessing Implementation Status

## âœ… What's Complete

### 1. Core Modules Implemented
- **`audio/preprocessor.py`**: Full audio preprocessing pipeline with AGC, compression, and limiting
- **`audio/microphone.py`**: Updated to support preprocessing
- **`audio/ring_buffer.py`**: Enhanced to support float32 audio
- **`config/manager.py`**: Updated to handle preprocessing configuration

### 2. Configuration Ready
- Preprocessing settings added to `config/settings.json` on the Pi:
  ```json
  "preprocessing": {
    "enable_agc": true,
    "agc_target_level": 0.3,
    "agc_max_gain": 10.0,
    "enable_compression": true,
    "compression_ratio": 4.0,
    "enable_limiter": true,
    "limiter_threshold": 0.95
  }
  ```

### 3. Verified Working
- Test script confirmed all modules load correctly
- AudioCapture initializes with preprocessing
- Configuration is properly loaded

## ðŸš§ Integration Status

The preprocessing modules are **ready to use** but not yet integrated into the main detection loop in `wake_word_detection.py`. This is because:

1. The monolithic file is complex (1227 lines)
2. Integration requires careful testing to avoid breaking existing functionality
3. The current system is working in production

## ðŸ“‹ How to Enable Preprocessing

### Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended)
Use the modular `app.py` approach which already supports AudioCapture:
```bash
hey-orac run --config /app/config/settings.json
```

### Option 2: Integrate into wake_word_detection.py
The integration points are identified:
- Replace direct stream reading with AudioCapture
- Use `audio_capture.get_audio_chunk()` instead of `stream.read()`
- Audio will be automatically preprocessed

### Option 3: Use Helper Functions
The `wake_word_detection_preprocessing.py` file provides helper functions to simplify integration.

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits When Enabled

1. **No more clipping** - Peak limiter prevents distortion
2. **Consistent volume** - AGC normalizes audio levels
3. **Better STT accuracy** - Clean, processed audio
4. **Real-time metrics** - Monitor audio quality

                                Metrics & Monitoring
```

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps

1. Test with the modular architecture first
2. Gradually integrate into production `wake_word_detection.py`
3. Monitor audio quality improvements
4. Fine-tune preprocessing parameters based on results

The preprocessing system is fully implemented and ready to improve audio quality for better STT accuracy!
